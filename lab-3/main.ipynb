    "# Задание:\n",
    "1. Выбрать тематику для поиска (например, “machine learning”, https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/recent) и использовать arXiv API для извлечения статей. Выгрузить названия, авторов и аннотации статей.\n",
    "2. Разбиение на чанки. Разделить текст аннотаций на чанки по 500 слов с перекрытием в 50 слов для последующей обработки (размер чанков и перекрытий можно скорректировать).\n",
    "3. Векторизация текста. Использовать модель эмбеддингов (например, ‘all-MiniLM-L6-v2’) для преобразования текстов в векторное представление. Построить векторное хранилище с помощью FAISS.\n",
    "4. Интеграция с LLM. Настроить взаимодействие с LLM (например, FLAN-T5 или OpenAI GPT). Использовать промпт для получения ключевых идей статьи или ответа на конкретный вопрос пользователя.\n",
    "5. Поиск по корпусу. Настроить промпт-инжиниринг для извлечения ключевых идей и результатов из текста. Добавить обработку опечаток в пользовательских запросах с использованием библиотек типа SymSpell или rapidfuzz. Протестируйте полученный результат. Рекомендуется привести в пример не менее пяти промптов. На примерах покажите, что RAG действительно улучшает качество ответов LLM.\n",

Existing approaches to\\nusing MITL in verification tasks, however, have notable drawbacks: they either\\nsupport only limited fragments of the logic or allow for only incomplete\\nverification. This paper introduces MightyPPL, a new tool for translating\\nformulae in Metric Interval Temporal Logic with Past and Pnueli modalities\\n(MITPPL) over the pointwise semantics into timed automata. MightyPPL enables\\nsatisfiability and model checking of a much more expressive specification logic\\nover both finite and infinite words and incorporates a number of performance\\noptimisations, including a novel symbolic encoding of transitions and a\\nsymmetry reduction technique that leads to an exponential improvement in the\\nnumber of reachable discrete states. For a given MITPPL formula, MightyPPL can\\ngenerate either a network of timed automata or a single timed automaton that is\\nlanguage-equivalent and compatible with multiple verification back-ends,\\nincluding Uppaal, TChecker, and LTSmin, which supports multi-core model\\nchecking. We evaluate the performance of the toolchain across various case\\nstudies and configuration options.',\n",

       "  'summary': \"Black-box context-free grammar inference is crucial for program analysis,\\nreverse engineering, and security, yet existing tools such as Arvada, TreeVada,\\nand Kedavra struggle with scalability, readability, and accuracy on large,\\ncomplex languages. We present NatGI, a novel LLM-guided grammar inference\\nframework that extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three key\\ninnovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration, LLM-driven bubble generation\\nand non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) for\\nsystematic tree simplification. Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic\\ncues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while\\nLLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising\\nmerges. Finally, HDD incrementally reduces unnecessary rules, which makes the\\ngrammars both compact and interpretable. In our experiments, we evaluate NatGI\\non a comprehensive benchmark suite ranging from small languages to larger ones\\nsuch as lua, c, and mysql. Our results show that NatGI consistently outperforms\\nstrong baselines in terms of F1 score. On average, NatGI achieves an F1 score\\nof 0.57, which is 25pp (percentage points) higher than the best-performing\\nbaseline, TreeVada. In the case of interpretability, our generated grammars\\nperform significantly better than those produced by existing approaches.\\nLeveraging LLM-based node renaming and bubble exploration, NatGI produces rules\\nwith meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align more\\nclosely with human intuition. As a result, developers and researchers can\\nachieve higher accuracy while still being able to easily inspect, verify, and\\nreason about the structure and semantics of the induced grammars.\",\n",

This leads to an optimisation problem in which the model's\\nparameter space is searched for, driven by the resemblance between the log's\\nand the model's stochastic languages. The bottleneck of such optimisation\\nproblem lay in the determination of the model's stochastic language which\\nexisting approaches deal with through, hardly scalable, exact computation\\napproaches. In this paper we introduce a novel framework in which we combine a\\nsimulation-based Bayesian parameter inference scheme, used to search for the\\n``optimal'' instance of a stochastic model, with an expressive statistical\\nmodel checking engine, used (during inference) to approximate the language of\\nthe considered model's instance.

In particular, for a given unsolvable planning problem, we\\npropose to identify common waypoints, which are universal obstacles to plan\\nexistence; in other words, they appear on every plan from the source to the\\nplanning goal. This work envisions such waypoints as sub-problems of the\\nplanning problem and the unreachability of any of these waypoints as an\\nexplanation for the unsolvability of the original planning problem. We propose\\na novel method of waypoint identification by casting the problem as an instance\\nof the longest common subsequence problem, a widely popular problem in computer\\nscience, typically considered as an illustrative example for the dynamic\\nprogramming paradigm. Once the waypoints are identified, we perform symbolic\\nreachability analysis on them to identify the earliest unreachable waypoint and\\nreport it as the explanation of unsolvability. We present experimental results\\non unsolvable planning problems in hybrid domains.',\n",

The\\ntranslation is particularly complex and has been revisited several times.

For\\nfair specifications, we present a new construction to synthesise an AA.

In this paper, we do not propose\\nany new safety criteria. Instead, we further investigate the role that the\\ncombinatorial component plays in the safety verification problem. First, we\\nprove that path-completeness, which is a property on a graph that describes the\\nswitching sequences, is necessary to obtain a set of valid safety conditions.\\nAs a result, the path-complete framework is able to provide a complete\\ncharacterization of safety conditions for switched systems. Furthermore, we\\nprovide a systematic methodology for comparing two path-complete graphs and the\\nconservatism associated with the resulting safety conditions. Specifically, we\\nprove that under some conditions, such as when there exists a simulation\\nrelation between two path-complete graphs, it is possible to conclude that one\\ngraph is always able to provide less conservative safety conditions than\\nanother, independent of the algebraic properties of the switched system and the\\ntemplate of the barrier function under consideration. Such a result paves the\\nway for a systematic use of the path-complete framework with barrier functions,\\nas one can then consistently choose the appropriate graph that provides less\\nconservative safety conditions.',\n",

The framework\\nis initially applied to verify model checkers solving the emptiness problem for\\nParametric TA and it is validated, in this specific scenario, by our tool,\\nTABEC, which randomly generates tests predicting their expected outcome through\\nautomated oracle generation. Furthermore, the general nature of TTA facilitates\\nthe framework adaptation to model checkers solving other decidable problems on\\nTA, as detailed for the minimum-cost reachability problem of Priced TA.',\n",

       "  'summary': \"In many fields, such as language acquisition, neuropsychology of language,\\nthe study of aging, and historical linguistics, corpora are used for estimating\\nthe diversity of grammatical structures that are produced during a period by an\\nindividual, community, or type of speakers. In these cases, treebanks are taken\\nas representative samples of the syntactic structures that might be\\nencountered. Generalizing the potential syntactic diversity from the structures\\ndocumented in a small corpus requires careful extrapolation whose accuracy is\\nconstrained by the limited size of representative sub-corpora. In this article,\\nI demonstrate -- theoretically, and empirically -- that a grammar's\\nderivational entropy and the mean length of the utterances (MLU) it generates\\nare fundamentally linked, giving rise to a new measure, the derivational\\nentropy rate. The mean length of utterances becomes the most practical index of\\nsyntactic complexity; I demonstrate that MLU is not a mere proxy, but a\\nfundamental measure of syntactic diversity. In combination with the new\\nderivational entropy rate measure, it provides a theory-free assessment of\\ngrammatical complexity. The derivational entropy rate indexes the rate at which\\ndifferent grammatical annotation frameworks determine the grammatical\\ncomplexity of treebanks. I introduce the Smoothed Induced Treebank Entropy\\n(SITE) as a tool for estimating these measures accurately, even from very small\\ntreebanks.

We then introduce a novel generalization of\\nbisimulation for labelled transition systems, weaker than strong bisimulation,\\nto show that our abstraction is sound and complete. Finally, using this\\nabstraction, we reduce the DNS verification problem to the verification problem\\nfor pushdown systems. To show the expressiveness of our framework, we model two\\nof the most prominent attack vectors on DNS, namely amplification attacks and\\nrewrite blackholing.',\n",

Traditional\\nviews of constituency demand that constituents consist of adjacent words, but\\nthis poses challenges in analysing syntax with non-local dependencies, common\\nin languages like German. Therefore, in a number of treebanks like NeGra and\\nTIGER for German and DPTB for English, long-range dependencies are represented\\nby crossing edges. Various grammar formalisms have been used to describe\\ndiscontinuous trees - often with high time complexities for parsing.\\nTransition-based parsing aims at reducing this factor by eliminating the need\\nfor an explicit grammar. Instead, neural networks are trained to produce trees\\ngiven raw text input using supervised learning on large annotated corpora. An\\nelegant proposal for a stack-free transition-based parser developed by Coavoux\\nand Cohen (2019) successfully allows for the derivation of any discontinuous\\nconstituent tree over a sentence in worst-case quadratic time.\\n  The purpose of this work is to explore the introduction of supertag\\ninformation into transition-based discontinuous constituent parsing.
